## 💡 Project Idea
Most digital games lack built-in accessibility features, making them inaccessible to individuals with disabilities. We propose a universal accessibility tool that works with any game by offering:

• Voice-controlled inputs for hands-free gaming.<br>
• Gesture-based controls for easy interaction.
<br>• Color filters for color blindness.
<br><br>
This tool promotes inclusive gaming by enabling players with disabilities to enjoy games without requiring modifications to the original game
## ✨ Key Features
- 🔍 Feature 1: Voice-controlled inputs for hands-free gaming.
- ⚡ Feature 2: Gesture-based controls for easy interaction.
- 🛡️ Feature 3: Color filters for color blindness.
